        <h1>Hi! Welcome to my site~</h1>
        <p>My name is Audasia Ho, but you can just call me Audi. I'm a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am also minoring in Human Computer Interaction. Currently, I am a Course Assistant for <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jxc/121.html" target="_blank">15-121: Introduction to Data Structures</a> and an Undergraduate Researcher at <a href="http://protolab.cs.cmu.edu/Home" target="_blank">The Protolab</a> at the Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
        <p>For now, in the broader sense, I am most interested in how people use computers/technology to increase their quality of life. I would like to design software that greatly impacts the lives of the people who use it, by either improving or creating new, innovative ways to better the world. With the software I make, I would like to be able to help maintain and improve relationships between people.</p>
        <p> I have experience in iOS programming, but would like to build up knowledge on front end web development (which is why I tried to make myself a site!). However, I still do not have a concrete idea of what I want to do in the future, and thus I would like to try out any and all experiences that I can possibly have.</p>
        <p>This past summer, I had the opportunity to do research with The Protolab at Carnegie Mellon for 6 weeks. During that time I worked on a project that dealt with visualizations of ideas. We wanted to see if different visualizations of crowd-sourced ideas would facilitate the generation of more good ideas. After that, I was a Facebook University Intern at Facebook. While there, I worked with another FBU intern and a iOS Engineer mentor to create a stand alone iOS application. Our app, <i>Fledge</i>, is a location based favor sharing service that allows you to ask nearby friends for help, as this has been proven to strengthen friendships.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 2015 I will be a Software Engineering Intern at Facebook. I'm super excited and looking forward to finding out what project I'll be working on.</p>
        <p>Outside of coursework I am also interested in communication design and art! A portfolio page is coming soon!</p>
        <p>At CMU I am a member of <a href="https://aphiokappa.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Alpha Phi Omega</a>, a sister of <a href="http://www.cmualphachiomega.com/" target="_blank">Alpha Chi Omega</a>, and the historian for the <a href="http://cmu-tsa.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Taiwanese Student Association</a>. I also love playing League of Legends, drinking bubble tea, and listening to K-Pop. </p>
